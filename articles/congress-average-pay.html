    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Politics in America has become an outrageous spectacle, and we're all paying the price. Career politicians sit in Congress collecting massive salaries while the average American fights to get by. These insiders pull in $174,000 a year plus lavish perks, while the typical worker earns around $63,000. What do we get in return? Endless gridlock, self-serving deals, and a government that feels more like a private club than a public institution. It's time for a brutal, no-nonsense solution: Cap politicians' pay at the national average wage. Make them live like the people they claim to represent. And while we're at it, pass a law that hits them hard for broken campaign promises. This isn't reform—it's a reckoning.</p>

      <h2>Force Them to Feel the Pain: Tie Pay to the National Average</h2>
      <p>Picture every member of Congress, senator, and even the president earning exactly what the median American worker makes—no more, no less. Right now, that's roughly $63,000 a year. That's barely enough to cover a mortgage in most cities, let alone the inflated lifestyle of Washington, D.C. Suddenly, these lawmakers would have real skin in the game. Want a raise? Then deliver real economic results for everyone—not just your biggest donors. No more rubber-stamping tax breaks for billionaires while inflation crushes working families. They'd be forced to actually work together across party lines because their own paycheck would depend on tangible progress.</p>

      <p>This single change would dismantle the foundation of corruption. When the game stops being insanely lucrative, the grifters and opportunists vanish overnight. Only the truly dedicated—people who genuinely want to serve the public—would stay in the fight. The revolving door to high-paid lobbying jobs would slam shut. No more insider trading scandals or sweetheart deals with corporate giants. A government run by people who understand what it means to live on an average income would finally start prioritizing real Americans over special interests.</p>

      <p>And yes, we'd lose some of the so-called "talent." That's exactly the point. If you need a six-figure salary to "serve the people," you're in the wrong profession. Public service should never be a path to personal wealth. This policy would attract fresh voices—teachers, nurses, small-business owners—who actually know what everyday struggle feels like. Balanced budgets, real infrastructure investment, and meaningful reform would suddenly become urgent priorities—because their own financial security would depend on it.</p>

      <h2>Criminalize Broken Promises: End the Campaign Circus</h2>
      <p>Salary caps alone won't fix everything. Elections have turned into high-stakes popularity contests where candidates promise the moon and deliver dust. "I'll end inflation overnight!" "I'll build a wall and Mexico will pay!" "Free college for everyone!"—bold slogans designed to win votes, not solve problems. These promises often fall outside the politician's actual authority, yet voters get blamed for believing the hype. It's time to stop treating campaigns like reality television.</p>

      <p>Introduce the <strong>Campaign Promise Accountability Act</strong>. Make it federal law: Any demonstrably false or impossible campaign promise triggers severe financial penalties, paid from campaign funds or personal assets. Repeat offenders face disqualification from future runs. This isn't about silencing speech; it's about holding leaders to basic truth-in-advertising standards. Businesses face massive fines for false claims—why should politicians get a free pass when the stakes are so much higher?</p>

      <p>This law would force candidates to campaign on realistic, achievable plans instead of pandering to extremes. No more empty soundbites or pie-in-the-sky pledges. Voters would finally get substance over spectacle, and politicians would think twice before making promises they know they can't keep. The era of treating elections like a class president race—promising no homework when you don't control the curriculum—would finally end.</p>

      <h2>The Outcome: A Government That Actually Serves</h2>
      <p>Imagine a Congress where red and blue are forced to find common ground because their own livelihoods depend on results. No more government shutdowns over petty power plays. No more trillion-dollar deficits passed on to future generations. Corruption would collapse when the financial incentives disappear. And with real consequences for lies, campaigns would shift from personality contests to serious policy debates.</p>

      <p>Yes, the transition would be chaotic. Many entrenched politicians would quit in outrage. That's not a bug—it's the feature. We'd clear out the careerists and replace them with people who actually care about the country more than their bank accounts.</p>

      <p>America is worth more than this broken system. It's time to stop rewarding failure and start demanding accountability. Pay politicians what the average American earns. Punish broken promises. Force them to live like the rest of us. Only then will we get the government we deserve—one that finally puts people before power.</p>

      <p>The question isn't whether this would work.<br>
      The question is: Are we brave enough to demand it?</p>
