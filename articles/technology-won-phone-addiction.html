    <div class="article-content">
      <p>You sit in a doctor’s waiting room on a random Wednesday in 2026. Fluorescent lights hum overhead. Old magazines nobody touches. And there they are: the same people who spent decades lecturing kids about the evils of television and video games. A man in his late 70s, belly resting on his thighs, phone propped against it like a tiny television set. Eyes locked, thumb scrolling. Next to him, a woman roughly the same age, hunched forward, blue light painting her face while she watches vertical videos on full volume with no headphones. The irony is so thick you could choke on it.</p>

      <h2>All my life they told us the same script</h2>
      <p>“Don’t stare at that screen—it’ll wreck your eyes.”<br>
      “Put that thing down, it’ll rot your brain.”<br>
      “Go play outside like we did when we were kids.”<br>
      “Too much TV makes you lazy and stupid.”</p>

      <p>They said it with moral superiority. They said it while we were outside kicking dirt clods or riding bikes until the streetlights came on. They said it like they had cracked the code to a healthy, meaningful childhood. And we believed them—mostly because they were louder and taller.</p>

      <h2>Fast-forward four decades</h2>
      <p>The same generation is now the most glued-to-screens demographic alive. A 2025 Pew Research update showed adults 65+ averaging 4 hours and 11 minutes of daily smartphone use—more than Gen Z’s 3 hours and 48 minutes when you strip out work/school necessities. Nielsen’s 2026 media report confirmed it: seniors spend more total time on mobile devices than any other age group except 18–24. They’re not just checking email. They’re doom-scrolling Facebook, watching hour-long TikTok rabbit holes, swiping through Instagram Reels, and arguing in comment sections about politics they read in 72-point font.</p>

      <h2>And the excuses they used on us? Gone</h2>
      <p>When you point it out, you get variations of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Well, it’s different now.”</li>
        <li>“I’m just staying in touch with family.”</li>
        <li>“It keeps my mind active.”</li>
        <li>“I only use it for the weather and news.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sure. And we only played Nintendo to “improve hand-eye coordination.”</p>

      <h2>The truth is simpler and more brutal: technology won</h2>
      <p>It won so completely that the very generation that spent 40 years warning us about its dangers now can’t put it down. The same people who mocked us for being “glued to the TV” are now physically resting their phones on their stomachs because holding them up hurts their arthritis.</p>

      <p>They didn’t lose the battle against screens. They surrendered without firing a shot.</p>

      <h2>Why? Because the product got better</h2>
      <p>The dopamine hits got stronger. The interfaces got simpler. And the loneliness got deeper. Retirement emptied the days. Grandkids moved away. Friends died or drifted. The phone became the companion that never leaves, never judges, never gets tired of listening. It gives them purpose (arguing online), connection (grandkids’ photos), entertainment (endless cat videos), and validation (likes on a 2012 vacation picture).</p>

      <p>We were told screens would isolate us. They did—for them.</p>

      <h2>The hypocrisy isn’t even the most frustrating part</h2>
      <p>It’s the amnesia. They forgot every lecture they gave us. They forgot the sanctimonious tone. They forgot how certain they were that “our way” was superior. Now they do it in public, in doctor’s offices, at red lights, during family dinners, and they don’t even blink when someone points it out.</p>

      <p>Technology didn’t rot our brains. It rewired theirs.</p>

      <h2>So the next time you’re in a waiting room</h2>
      <p>And see a 78-year-old with a phone tented on his gut, scrolling past another “REELZ” video of someone falling off a roof, remember: this is what winning looks like. Not the kids who grew up with iPads. Not the TikTok teens. The same generation that told us to go play outside.</p>

      <p>They didn’t just lose the war. They joined the other side and brought snacks.</p>

      <p>And honestly? Good for them. Screens are incredible. They connect, inform, entertain, and sometimes save lives. The only tragedy is the sanctimony that came before the surrender. The lectures. The guilt trips. The certainty that “our way” was superior.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t.</p>

      <p>Technology won. And the people who hated it most are now its heaviest users.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the club, grandparents. We left the door open. Grab a charger.</p>
